This Thunderbird add-on installs a custom action filter provides interface to a binary program that can set a color and can switch on and off the USB-device. On incoming mails you can let blink the LED device.

The Add-on installs a binary program on the computer to interface the hardware. Maybe a antivirus programm will check it while installation. All binaries are build on a Linux host. There are binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac ind a 32bit and 64bit program.
