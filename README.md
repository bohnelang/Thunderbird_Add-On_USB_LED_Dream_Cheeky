# Thunderbird Add-On for interfacing LED Dream Cheeky DL100B Webmail Notifier. 

*This add-on is outdated - the last version you can run is Thunderbird 68.0. With Thunderbird 78 a new add-on-API was implemented and at the moement I do not have thome to update implementation...*

This Thunderbird add-on installs a custom action filter that provides an  interface to a binary program that can set a color and can switch on and off the USB-device. On incoming mails you can let blink the LED gadget :-)

The add-on contains binary programs to interface the hardware. Maybe a antivirus programm will check it while installation. All binaries are build on a Linux host. There are binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac in a 32bit and 64bit program.

## Installation:

Unitl this extension is not in the official Thunderbird repository you need to download and install this one manualy. 

Download the xpi-file to a local device. Then open the main menu (see section "Settings" for an image) and scroll down to the Add-ons entry. Click this entry. Click again the Add-ons entry in the new box. Then open the menu (right top) and choose "Install Add-on from File".

Important: On Linux devices you need to allow normal user to access hardware like this USB-device. You need to intall an udev-rule (see 24-LED-notifier.rules). Otherwise only root is able to access the USB-device.

## Activate and enable the filter
For each mail account you can enable a mail filter and you can set different colores for different accounts. The following images shows how to enable this new custom filter.
